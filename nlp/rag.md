Key concepts involved in the RAG equation:\
\
• Indexing\
• Loading\
• Splitting\
• Embedding\
• Storing\
• Retrieval\
• Augmentation\
• Generation\
\
If time permits, I may talk about advanced techniques such as\
\
• Multiple Embedding Spaces\
• RankGPT\
• Multi-query Retrieval\
• Contextual Compression\
• Hypothetic Document Embeddings\
