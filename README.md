# Introduction

This is a WIP. Materials are curated from various sources. Apologies if I've missed linking/sourcing anything!&#x20;



The pain point which inspired this project:&#x20;

Resources that explain/detail different areas of ML are spread across many locations - papers, articles, books, videos, social media (LinkedIn, X), LLMs (chatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity), GitHub etc. To deep dive into a certain topic, I found I would have an embarrassing number of tabs open, some of which would get buried and never revisited. Especially those which take longer to study than others. This single source aims to bring together the best I have found to provide an efficient and effective way to learn about ML as it constantly evolves.
